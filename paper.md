# Summary
In dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) 
a sequence of MRI images are acquired to measure the passage of a
contrast-agent within a tissue of interest. Quantitative DCE-MRI (DCE-MRI), in which
one or more tracer-kinetic models are fitted to the contrast-agent
concentration time-series, enables the estimation of clinically useful parameters of tissue microvasculature.

# Acknowledgements

Code updates to the open source version of `Madym` have been made entirely by Michael Berks, with significant input on the design
and features of the new version from the remaining authors. We would also like to thank Gio Buonnacorsi, Anita Banerji and Angela Caunce
for their work in developing previous non-public versions, following Geoff Parker's original design.
